Project 1 Dogtionary

## User Story

As a dog lover

I want to select a breed of dog.

When I open the Dogtionary

I want to be able to select a dog breed from the drop down menu or type the breed name in the search box.

Then I want to see facts and/or an image of the dog breed. 

Then I want to see local places where I might be able to adopt a dog of this breed.
